Implement a shell with the following functionalities:- supports the internal command 'exit';- accepts external commands with any number of arguments;- supports external command filters; The filter can have any number of components and the commands can have any number of arguments and can contain directions to files, of the form 'no]', 'no]]', 'no[', ']', ']]', '[' (the descriptor 'no' is redirected, which, by default, is 0 to '[' and 1 to ']' and ']]'); the redirects have precedence over '|'. We will work only in the C language, without directly or indirectly calling the shell in the system.
